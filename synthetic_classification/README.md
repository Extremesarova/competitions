# Synthetic classification

This folder contains two problems: [simple](https://github.com/Extremesarova/mini_projects/tree/main/synthetic_classification/simple_classification) and [complex](https://github.com/Extremesarova/mini_projects/tree/main/synthetic_classification/complex_classification) classification.

The idea is to practice on small synthetic datasets before interview.
